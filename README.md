## Project Goal
This project is a Progressive Web App designed to help the [Emory Farmworker Project (EFWP)](https://med.emory.edu/departments/family-preventive/divisions-programs/physician-assistant-program/farmworker-project.html) manage their mobile clinic's medication inventory. The primary goal is to provide a reliable, offline-first tool to replace their current paper-based system.

## Key Features
* **Real-Time Inventory Tracking:** Provides an up-to-date view of the medication formulary.
* **Electronic Dispensing Logs:** Allows for accurate, digital logging of dispensed medications.
* **Offline-First Functionality:** Core features are designed to work seamlessly in environments with poor or no internet connection.
